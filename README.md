# My Tecker Website Idea
### I had an idea I wanted to sketch...

I wanted to create a website where all tech lovers could go and start communities and explore endless amounts of tech products.

1. They'd be able to login and have their own profile where they can add friends and also post their own tech stash on their wall where they can sell.
2. They can find anything from the newest iphone to cameras used in the film industry.
3. On the main page, or even their profile page, they'll find a button that reads "start community". They'll be able to start a community and customize it to their needs.
